Here I have discussed only my thouught process :

1)  First covert the given image into binary img by applying threshold 
2) Find contours 
3 ) Find shape of the contours by the cv2.approxPolyDP() function
4) Then find the coordinated of the contours by .ravel() function
5) Then we have our coordinates , we can find the angle and distance by our coordinates and contour coordinates 
6) By that angle vs disttance graph can be drawn.
